## Description
This is a collaboration between Roanan Platt, Brian Hernandez, and Jaxon Adams. This simple web app allows you to grab a small list of flights leaving your local airport to help plan a getaway. Once you've decided where you want to go, you can also use this site to get the current temperature in the city you'd like to visit. This makes it easy to make quick travel plans, and is perfect for when you just need to get away today.

## Instructions
To use this app, simply enter your local airport's ICAO code into the form. After you submit your code, a list of ten flights will appear on the page. These are a few flights leaving the selected airport today. Glance through them, and if you see somewhere you'd like to go, find it's zip code online and enter it into the corresponding form textbox. After submitting the zip code, scroll to the bottom of the page and you will see the current temperature in that city!
